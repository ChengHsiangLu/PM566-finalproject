# **The correlation of diabetes and obesity with physical inactivity in the US in 2017.**

In this project, I gather two datasets which are talking about "diagnosed diabetes among adults aged >=18 years" and "Obesity among adults aged >=18 years" in the US in 2017 from the CDC. I also download one dataset which is the "Prevalence of Self-Reported Physical Inactivity Among US Adults by State and Territory, 2017â€“2020".

By merging these three dataset, I create different interesting plots such as leaflets, boxplots, and scatter plots to show their correlations.
